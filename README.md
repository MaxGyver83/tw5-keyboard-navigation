# tw5-keyboard-navigation
Navigate through your TiddlyWiki5 with your keyboard: jump to next/previous tiddler, edit or close tiddler

## Demonstration/Installation
Check [this demonstration](https://maximilian-schillinger.de/tw5-keyboard-navigation-plugin.html) of tw-keyboard-navigation! You can integrate `tw5-keyboard-navigation` by dragging the plugin tiddler from the demo page into your TiddlyWiki.

## How to use
Press `Esc` to unfocus the sidebar search field.
Then you can jump to the next or previous open tiddler in the story river by pressing `j` or `k`, respectively.
Press `e` if you want to edit the current tiddler. Press `Ctrl+Return` when you're done (as usual).
`c` is for closing a tiddler.

When you search your TiddlyWiki, just press `Return` to open or `Tab` to focus the first match (without this plugin you have to press `Tab` four times).
