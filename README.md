# tw5-keyboard-navigation
Navigate through your TiddlyWiki5 with your keyboard: jump to next/previous tiddler, edit or close tiddler

## Demonstration
Check [this demonstation](http://maximilian-schillinger.de/tw5-keyboard-navigation.html) of tw-keyboard-navigation!

## Installation
So far this is not a complete plugin. You can integrate tw5-keyboard-navigation by dragging these tiddlers into your TiddlyWiki: `navigation.js` and `CSS.tid`.

## How to use
Press `Esc` to unfocus the sidebar search field.
Then you can jump to the next or previous open tiddler in the storyriver by pressing `j` or `k`, respectively.
Press `e` if you want to edit the current tiddler. Press `Ctrl+Return` when you're down (as usual).
`c` is for closing a tiddler.
